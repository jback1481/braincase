      <![CDATA[<p>The binocular microscope uses two sets of lenses to magnify a specimen. The lenses closest to your eyes are called eyepieces. The lenses above the microscope stage (where you place the specimen) are called objectives. There are also lenses to focus light from the light source in the base of the microscope onto the specimen.<br /><br />Light travels from the light source, through the specimen, into the objective, through the microscope tube, into the eyepieces, and into your eyes. The microscope focuses the image of the specimen on the retina at the back of your eye.</p>]]>
