    <![CDATA[<p>The ability of a microscope to magnify small specimens depends on the ability of a lens to refract (bend) light. Typically, microscopes have two lens assemblies separated by a tube. The objective is located close to the specimen and the eyepiece is located close to the viewerâ€™s eye.</p>]]>
