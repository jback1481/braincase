      <![CDATA[<p>Notice that the higher power lenses are closer to the specimen. Higher power lenses have a shorter working distance. Often 100X objective lenses are used with a drop of oil that connects the end of the lens and the cover slip of the slide.<br /><br />You can find the total magnification by multiplying the magnification of the objective lens times the magnification of the eyepiece lens.<br /><br />The eyepieces on this binocular microscope are 10X. So with a 10X objective, the specimen is magnified 10 x 10 = 100 times.</p>]]>
