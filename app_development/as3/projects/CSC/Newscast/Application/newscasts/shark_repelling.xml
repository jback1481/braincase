This is _________, and you’re watching the Science Buzz News Network. Here at SBNN, we make it our mission to provide you with what I like to call “news you can use.”</p>]]></passage></actor><actor><name><![CDATA[<p class="actor1">OTHER PERSON</p>]]></name><passage><![CDATA[<p class="story">A lot of people use that phrase.</p>]]></passage></actor><actor><name><![CDATA[<p class="actor1">HOST</p>]]></name><passage><![CDATA[<p class="story">But I invented it. How’s that for news you can use? Generally guests on Science Buzz wait to be introduced before they speak, but there are always some people with no respect for tradition. We have with us tonight, Dr. _________, a marine biologist. Now, “Doctor,” I understand you have some interesting new findings for us about sharks.</p>]]></passage></actor><actor><name><![CDATA[<p class="actor1">Dr. _________</p>]]></name><passage><![CDATA[<p class="story">Thank you, __________. Yes, there has been some remarkable research on sharks recently. In particular, we’re finding that sharks are repelled by certain types of metals.</p>]]></passage></actor><actor><name><![CDATA[<p class="actor1">HOST</p>]]></name><passage><![CDATA[<p class="story">Ah, you’re referring to bullets, of course.</p>]]></passage></actor><actor><name><![CDATA[<p class="actor1">Dr. _________</p>]]></name><passage><![CDATA[<p class="story">No, actually, it seems that some rare earth—</p>]]></passage></actor><actor><name><![CDATA[<p class="actor1">HOST</p>]]></name><passage><![CDATA[<p class="story">Wait, so you’re trying to claim that sharks are bulletproof? I find that hard to believe.</p>]]></passage></actor><actor><name><![CDATA[<p class="actor1">Dr. _________</p>]]></name><passage><![CDATA[<p class="story">Well, no, not at all, but__</p>]]></passage></actor><actor><name><![CDATA[<p class="actor1">HOST</p>]]></name><passage><![CDATA[<p class="story">So you’re saying that sharks don’t mind getting shot? Because I think it’s a pretty safe bet that shooting a shark right in the blowhole would be a pretty good repellent.</p>]]></passage></actor><actor><name><![CDATA[<p class="actor1">Dr. _________</p>]]></name><passage><![CDATA[<p class="story">Sharks don’t have blowholes. You’re thinking of dolphins.</p>]]></passage></actor><actor><name><![CDATA[<p class="actor1">HOST</p>]]></name><passage><![CDATA[<p class="story">No, you’re wrong, I’m thinking of sharks. But, fine, the fin then. Shooting a shark in the fin wouldn’t repel it?</p>]]></passage></actor><actor><name><![CDATA[<p class="actor1">Dr. _________</p>]]></name><passage><![CDATA[<p class="story">…Yes, I suppose that might repel a shark.</p>]]></passage></actor><actor><name><![CDATA[<p class="actor1">HOST</p>]]></name><passage><![CDATA[<p class="story">Interesting. And what metal are these bullets made of?</p>]]></passage></actor><actor><name><![CDATA[<p class="actor1">Dr. _________</p>]]></name><passage><![CDATA[<p class="story">I don’t really know. But that’s not what the study was about. We’ve found that sharks also tend to avoid certain “rare earth metals,” because of the electric field they produce when immersed in seawater.</p>]]></passage></actor><actor><name><![CDATA[<p class="actor1">HOST</p>]]></name><passage><![CDATA[<p class="story">They electrocute the sharks?</p>]]></passage></actor><actor><name><![CDATA[<p class="actor1">Dr. _________</p>]]></name><passage><![CDATA[<p class="story">Not really. Sharks have the ability to detect the small electric fields produced by animals. This helps them detect prey species of fish. The stronger electric fields produced by the chemical reaction of these metals with seawater seems to overload the sharks’ senses, and they avoid them if at all possible.</p>]]></passage></actor><actor><name><![CDATA[<p class="actor1">HOST</p>]]></name><passage><![CDATA[<p class="story"> Like licking a battery. I’ll be avoiding that from now on.</p>]]></passage></actor><actor><name><![CDATA[<p class="actor1">Dr. _________</p>]]></name><passage><![CDATA[<p class="story">Sort of.</p>]]></passage></actor><actor><name><![CDATA[<p class="actor1">HOST</p>]]></name><passage><![CDATA[<p class="story">Or…it’s like kryptonite for sharks?</p>]]></passage></actor><actor><name><![CDATA[<p class="actor1">Dr. _________</p>]]></name><passage><![CDATA[<p class="story">Yeah, actually, kind of. And if we can attach these metals to some of the huge nets used in ocean fishing, it might prevent sharks from accidentally getting caught in them.</p>]]></passage></actor><actor><name><![CDATA[<p class="actor1">HOST</p>]]></name><passage><![CDATA[<p class="story">Why would we do that? We hate sharks.</p>]]></passage></actor><actor><name><![CDATA[<p class="actor1">Dr. _________</p>]]></name><passage><![CDATA[<p class="story">No, we don’t. About 12 million sharks are killed every year in nets meant for other kinds of fish, and their populations are dropping rapidly.</p>]]></passage></actor><actor><name><![CDATA[<p class="actor1">HOST</p>]]></name><passage><![CDATA[<p class="story">I hate them anyway. I don’t want to get eaten by a shark.</p>]]></passage></actor><actor><name><![CDATA[<p class="actor1">Dr. _________</p>]]></name><passage><![CDATA[<p class="story">But you’re in Minnesota.
