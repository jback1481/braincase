OCD Division IDs
These ids are used by the Google Civic Information API, and can be downloaded from GitHub at: https://github.com/opencivicdata/ocd-division-ids/tree/master/identifiers/country-us.
There are other countries as well, and is the de facto source for ocd division ids.

Drop them in this folder for use, you will have to adjust the code for using a different CSV file than the one for the state of Illinois.

For more explanation, feel free to e-mail me, or read up on the Google Civic Information API from clicking on the links on the settings page of this module.
